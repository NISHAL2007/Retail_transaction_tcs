## Usage

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for retail transaction data analysis:

1. **Data Inspection**: Understand basic properties of the dataset (size, structure, missing values, duplicates) and prepare for cleansing.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Remove or resolve errors in the data (missing values, inconsistent categories, duplicate transactions, negative/zero quantities/prices).
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new informative columns such as purchase month, day of week, and age group to enable more meaningful analysis and segmentation.
4. **Encoding & Transformation**: Prepare the data for modeling and visualization by encoding categorical variables and scaling select numeric fields as needed.
5. **Visualization & Insights**: Use charts (histograms, bar, pie, heatmaps, etc.) to uncover customer demographics, sales patterns, payment preferences, and city/category influences.

**Why it is used:**
- To turn raw transactional data into actionable business insights.
- To support retail strategy, marketing, operations, and executive reporting with clear visual evidence.
- To learn and demonstrate data science best practices as a student project.

Run `task.ipynb` stepwise for analysis or customize scripts for your own data.
